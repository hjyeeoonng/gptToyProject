    Q: Your color is black, player color is white. It's player's turn. Please recommend 5 good moves in a given notation situation for players with reasons in good order. chess notation of this game is : ['1.e4 e5']
    A: {Nf3, d4, Bc4, Nc3, O-O}
    1. Nf3: This move develops the knight and controls the center of the board. It also prepares for future development of the bishop to f4.
    2. d4: This move helps to open up the center and gain more control over the board. It also allows for potential quick development of the queen and the light-square bishop.
    3. Bc4: By developing the bishop to c4, white puts pressure on the f7 square, which is a weak spot in black's position. This move also opens up the possibility of lining up the bishop with the queen on the central file.
    4. Nc3: This move continues with the development of the knights and aims to establish more control in the center. It also prepares for potential future pawn breaks in the center with moves like d4 or e5.
    5. O-O: Castling kingside not only moves the king to safety but also connects the rooks and improves the overall coordination of the pieces. This move is essential for protecting the king and preparing for the middlegame.
